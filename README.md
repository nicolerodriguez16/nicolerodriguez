Hi, I'm Nicole! ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to my little github corner! Hereâ€™s a little bit about me:

I am currently a senior at Baruch College (CUNY), majoring in Computer Information Systems with a concentration in Data Analytics! Iâ€™m actively involved with organizations like Break Through Tech, Girls Who Code, Rewriting the Code, and Rebooting Representation, where I get to work on exciting projects and initiatives aimed at increasing diversity and inclusion in tech.
# Fun Facts About Me
My dogâ€™s birthday falls on the same day as mine, so we always have a little gathering with a dog cake for her and one for me!
Iâ€™ve rewatched The Office and The Sopranos several times a year; theyâ€™re my favorite background noise while working on homework.

# Major Projects Iâ€™m Currently Working On
Academic RAG Pipeline (Axle Informatics - Break Through Tech AI):
Worked in a team to focus on PDF parsing and analysis for arXiv academic papers as part of the Break Through Tech AI Program's Fall 2024 AI Studio.

Evaluated multiple PDF parsing approaches, including docTR, Kosmos, Marker, LlamaParse, and PyMuPDF.
Implemented word embedding comparisons using cosine similarity.
Analyzed parser performance for text, equations, and tables.

Flight Price Prediction (Cloud Computing, Baruch College):
For a semester-long machine learning project, I analyzed flight price data from Expedia (31.09 GB) between 2022-04-16 and 2022-10-05, sourced from Kaggle.

The dataset included ticket information for flights to/from major airports (e.g., ATL, DFW, JFK, LAX).
Performed exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and modeling using Google Cloud Storage, DataProc, Compute Engine, PySpark, and Hadoop.
Results with linear regression:
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 119.36
R-Squared: 0.515

# Technical Skils
Languages: Python, SQL, R, HTML Applications: Tableau, PowerBI, DataGrip, VSCode 
Databases & Cloud: MySQL, MS Access, PostgreSQL, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Storage, Google Big Query
